Conclusion Notebook
* Needs: one conclusion paragraph from each team member that summarizes their individual work / findings / reflections on their findings
* Type / copypaste your answer here and I'll put them all in one Jupyter markdown file

While the data is not complete because we do not have the population in each neighborhood (since it is not included in this dataset), we can assume 
that the "best" neighborhood is Mount Oliver Borough. Of course this is not completely accurately since we are still missing a lot of criteria that 
would be extremely useful, such as the information included in the other datasets. However, with the data that we have, Mount Oliver Borough is an
accurate answer of the question. I reached this conclusion by looking at the amount of fires in each neighborhood, and checking what were the causes
of the fires in the neighborhoods with the least amount. I also included the bar graph because, even though it is not legible at all, the difference
in the amount of fires can be seen between the top neighborhood and the bottom neighborhood.
