While the data is not complete because we do not have the population in each neighborhood (since it is not included in this dataset), we can assume 
that the "best" neighborhood is MountOliver Borough. Of course this is not completely accurately since we are still missing a lot of criteria that 
would be extremely useful, such as the information included in the other datasets. However, with the data that we have, Mount Oliver Borough is an
accurate answer of the question.
