When our group first came together and brainstormed what exactly we should measure the neighborhoods by in order to select the "best," we all agreed that safety
is the most important factor for ensuring a high quality of life. From there, we decided to use datasets that all correlated to neighborhood safety in an
apparent way. Safety is a relatively broad subject, so our datasets pertaining to arrests, firearm seizures, and reported fires all fit well into this category.

Sloane's Conclusion:



Aaron's Conclusion:

  While my data is not complete because the population of each neighborhood is not included in my dataset, I can assume from my analysis
that the "best" neighborhood in terms of fire occurrences is Mount Oliver Borough. With the data that was available from my dataset, Mount Oliver Borough is an
accurate answer to the question as it had the least amount of fires compared to every other neighborhood in the Pittsburgh area. I reached this conclusion by finding
the amount of fires in each neighborhood and comparing the fires' causes in the neighborhoods with the smallest amount. I also included the bar graph because, although
the neighborhood names are not legible, the graph displays the overall difference in the amount of fires for all of the neighborhoods.
